Most of its influences come from its lengthy past and Buddhist background. The nation has a strong heritage of the fine arts, which includes music, dance, and visual arts. Sri Lankan food, festivals, and sports all represent the country&#39;s way of life. Many features show South Indian influences. Portuguese, Dutch, and British colonization all had an impact in certain ways. Cricket, cuisine, alternative medicine, religious symbols like the Buddhist flag, and cultural exports like tea, cinnamon, and diamonds are what Sri Lankan culture is most known for overseas. The culture of Sri Lanka is diverse since it differs from area to region. </p><p class="mainP"> The island&#39;s cultural triangle, which is home to the remnants of multiple ancient kingdoms, gigantic tanks, well-kept rock caverns, and ancient holy temples, reveals the amazing and nearly impossible ancient engineering, architecture, and art. </p><p class="mainP"> The North of Sri Lanka is a colorful mixture of flavors, each with their own distinct flavor and culture. The north is a true monument to the island&#39;s richness and variety, albeit still showing signs of the civil war. Portuguese, Dutch, Tamil, Muslim, and British characters are influences. Off the coast, chains of islands with their own distinctive environments are dispersed and just waiting to be discovered. </p><p class="mainP"> Since ancient times, Sri Lanka and the Indian subcontinent have been connected. Sinhalese make of 74.8% of the population, followed by Sri Lankan Moors (9.23%), Indian Tamil (4.16%), Sri Lankan Tamil (11.21%), and Other (0.6%). <br> Due mostly to ancient historical texts like the Mahawansa, Sri Lanka can boast of a history that spans more than 2000 years. Intermittent foreign influence throughout many centuries has changed Sri Lankan culture to its current state. However, the island&#39;s predominantly conservative Sinhalese population, along with other minorities that contribute to Sri Lankan identity, continue to observe traditional customs and festivals. <br></p></div>',2);function r(e,a,n,r,o,c){const l=(0,t.up)("Footer");return(0,t.wg)(),(0,t.iD)("div",i,[s,(0,t.Wm)(l)])}var o=n(5412),c={name:"CulturalView",components:{Footer:o.Z}},l=n(89);const u=(0,l.Z)(c,[["render",r]]);var h=u}}]);
