Asian elephants, sloth bears, leopards, sambar, and \n           wild buffaloes draw the most of the interest of wildlife enthusiasts out of the \n           ninety-one species of mammals present in Sri Lanka. The Red Slender Loris, Toque \n           Macaque, and Purple-faced Langur, however, are the rarest mammals in Sri Lanka and \n           are deemed to be endangered owing to habitat loss by the IUCN.\n        </p>\n        <br>\n        <p>\n           Large families of cetaceans, including powerful blue whales, \n           sperm whales, and playful dolphins, reside in the seas near Sri Lanka. \n           The waterways around the nation are home to 26 different species of cetaceans, making it \n           one of the greatest places in the world to go whale and dolphin watching.<br>\n           \n           Although the island is home to unique amphibians and powerful elephants, birds are \n           the pride of Sri Lanka's fauna. With over 433 bird species, 233 of which are resident, \n           Sri Lanka is home to 20 endemic species. In contrast to their relatives on the Indian \n           mainland, another 80 species have formed unique Sri Lankan races.<br>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n           Despite receiving less attention, Sri Lanka is home to one of the world's highest \n           diversitys of amphibians, with over 106 species, of which over 90 are endemic. \n           With a significant concentration in the Sinharaja rainforest, the nation has \n           long asserted that it boasts the world's largest density of amphibian species.\n        </p>\n           <br>\n        <p>\n        <h3>NATIONAL PARK OF LAHUGALA</h3>\n           On Sri Lanka's east coast, not far from Arugam Bay, sits Lahugala, the country's \n           smallest national park. It may be tiny, but it is well constructed, and the parks' \n           extensive beru grass cover makes it a favorite feeding spot for the region's 500 Asian elephants.<br>\n\n           Another feature of the park is that it is one of the few that really allows you to get out of the car \n           and go for a walk, giving you a chance to get some exercise and learn more about the surrounding environment. \n           The water-filled wewas also include several lily species, which in turn support a variety \n           of insects and birds in addition to the beru grass. A sizable population of grey langurs, \n           wild pigs, spotted deer, as well as a huge variety of wading birds and raptors, \n           are also found in the park.<br>\n\n           The park might be difficult to get due to its remote position, but if you're \n           looking for some quiet, nature, elephants, and tranquility, this is the place for you. \n           Come early in the day to view the park's resident crocodiles enjoying the sun, or \n           stay until late in the day to see the elephants graze.\n        </p>\n          <br>\n        <p>\n        <h3>WILPATTU NATIONAL PARK</h3>\n            Experience Sri Lanka's most secretive animals in Wilpattu National Park's \n            immense isolation. This is Sri Lanka's largest and oldest wildlife reserve, \n            taking up a sizable area of land that borders the northwestern coast's copper-sand \n            beaches, the Cultural Triangle's ancient ruins, and the Northern Province. The park \n            supports amazing birdlife, Asian elephants, Sri Lankan leopards, and Sri Lankan sloth \n            bears in addition to being home to other rare species. \n        </p>\n        <br>\n        <p>\n        <h3>YALA NATIONAL PARK</h3>\n            Yala is a national park combined with a stringent nature reserve. The park, which is \n            divided into 5 blocks, protects an area of territory covering close to 130,000 hectares and \n            is made up of light woods, scrubs, grasslands, tanks, and lagoons. The public may \n            now access two blocks. <br>\n\n            Yala was established as a wildlife sanctuary in 1900 and as a national park in 1938. \n            It is located in Sri Lanka's south-east, abutting the expansive Indian Ocean. Ironically, \n            while Britain was in power, the park was first utilized as a hunting area for the affluent. \n            215 bird species and 44 different types of mammals may be found in Yala. The largest \n            concentration of leopards, stately elephants, sloth bears, sambars, jackals, spotted dear, \n            peacocks, and crocodiles are just a few of its most well-known inhabitants. \n\n        </p>\n        <br>\n        <p>\n        <h3>MINNERIYA NATIONAL PARK</h3>\n            In Sri Lanka's North Central Province, 182 miles from Colombo, is where you'll find Minneriya \n            National Park. Habarana and Polonnaruwa are the two significant cities nearest to Minneriya \n            National Park. <br>\n\n            The main point of the Minneriya National Park is the restored, sizable, historic Minneriya \n            Rainwater Reservoir, which irrigates a sizable portion of the district of Polonnaruwa.<br>\n\n            Being a part of the elephant corridor that connects Minneriya National Park with Kaudulla \n            and Wasgamuwa National Parks allows visitors to view elephant herds all year round. The best \n            time to visit Minneriya National Park is from May to October in order to see the famed Great \n            Elephant Gathering of Asian wild elephants. \n        </p>\n          <br>\n        <p>\n        <h3>UDAWALAWE NATIONAL PARK</h3>\n            In order to provide a sanctuary for species driven out by the construction of the Uda Walawe dam, \n            Udawalawe National Park was established in 1972.\n            It has 119 square miles of open grassland, with marshes and deep vegetation, and is backed \n            by the magnificent hills to the north. If your children adore elephants, an Udawalawe National \n            Park safari is a fantastic option for a Sri Lankan safari because it has about 500 resident elephants. <br>\n            \n            Of all the Sri Lankan national parks, it boasts the highest density of Asian elephants. Elephant \n            sightings are almost a given on a safari through Udawalawe National Park because of the abundance \n            of water that draws them there.\n        </p>\n        <br>\n        <p>\n        <h3>PINNAWALA ELEPHANT ORPHANAGE</h3>\n           As its name indicates, the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage (PEO) has a special approach to caring \n           for ex-situ animals. Its popularity and success spread not just across the nation but also \n           around the world, making Pinnawala synonymous with the Sri Lankan elephant. <br>\n\n           The idea was realized by the late Hon. Minister Kalugalle on February 16, 1975, and is \n           now home to 93 elephants. At the time, Pinnawala was a fairly distant location with luxuriant \n           coconut plantations and, most importantly, a place where mahouts were not hard to come by. \n           Additionally, the presence of \"Ma oya\" running nearby helps to augment the enormous amount \n           of water needed by the elephants. \n\n        </p>\n        <br>\n    </div>\n\n    <div>\n        <!-- Here the google map feature is added with all the places-->\n    </div>\n    <Footer></Footer>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport Footer from '@/components/FooterComp.vue'\n\nexport default {\nname: 'WildLife',\ncomponents: {\n  Footer,\n    }\n}\n</script>","import { render } from \"./WildLife.vue?vue&type=template&id=df2b31a6\"\nimport script from \"./WildLife.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./WildLife.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"/workspace/cey/node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_2","_createVNode","_component_Footer","name","components","Footer","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
