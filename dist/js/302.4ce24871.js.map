Sri Lanka has it everything, whether\n            you like to do windsurfing, kayaking, yachting, water skiing, scuba\n            diving, or just relax for the ideal tan.<br />\n          </p>\n\n          <p class=\"mainP\">\n            Beach vacations in Sri Lanka are an option all year round because to\n            the two monsoon winds that bring rain to the two corners of the\n            island at different times. From November to March, the north east\n            breezes make the south western coast bright and the sea tranquil.\n            The East Coast seas are calm due to the south-west breezes and the\n            steady sunshine.<br />\n          </p>\n\n          <p class=\"mainP\">\n            The nicest beaches in the South may be found at Tangalla, Beruwala,\n            Mirissa, Bentota, and Unawatuna.

The Arugam\n            Bay, the high church of local surfers, is the most well-known of the\n            Eastern beaches.

In contrast\n         to many Sri Lankan beaches with heavy surf, this one has calm surf that is sheltered \n         by a reef. Additionally, because the water is shallow, you may walk hundreds of yards \n         out into the ocean. The beach is bordered with coconut palms and the sand is fine-grained, \n         dazzling white, and soft. There are several undeveloped beaches to find in this region, which \n         is just recently being found for the building of upscale resorts.</p>\n    \n        <p>Kalkudah Sands is a fantastic choice that is both inexpensive and full of facilities \n          for people looking for a quiet retreat right on the water's edge.

Trincomalee is 30 minutes away by car from this location in the northeast of \n            Sri Lanka. Due to its own little reef, this tiny island boasts tranquil beaches and \n            mild waves. Despite its size, Nilaveli's beach is a favorite among both locals and visitors. \n            Along the beach are several small eateries, the most of which specialize in seafood, and there \n            are lifeguards on duty.</p>\n    \n            <p>Due to its importance to Tamil culture, the Trincomalee region is also a fantastic \n              place to go sightseeing. Both the language used in Sri Lanka and the ethnic group to \n              which the vast majority of its citizens belong go by the name of Tamil.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"column2\">\n        <h3>ARUGAM BAY</h3>\n        <img id=\"boximg\" src=\"Images/arugambay.jpg\" alt=\"Arugam bay\">\n          <p>TThe strikingly gorgeous Arugam Bay has dazzling white sand and deep blue \n            sea that becomes green as you get closer to the beach. The beach is well-known \n            as an international surfing destination and comes with some of Sri Lanka's top surf breakers. \n            This reputation not only draws a lot of tourists, but it also indicates that the area is well-connected \n            and has a decent tourism infrastructure. The sloping beach has a Hawaiian-like feel to it with its dry, \n            sandy part near the ocean and rougher areas with plants and a tree line. \n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n\n    <div class=\"row\">\n      <div class=\"column2\">\n        <h3>MIRISSA BEACH</h3>\n        <img id=\"boximg\" src=\"Images/mirissa.jpg\" alt=\"Mirissa\">\n          <p>Mirissa Beach is formed like an arrow, with the point extending into the water. \n            The surf is also quiet and swimmable thanks to its natural jetty. The sea is incredibly pure, \n            and the beaches are dazzling white with smooth, fine sand. Where there are rocks or a reef, \n            the water is dark blue and is pale green where the bottom is sandy. Additionally, Mirissa is an \n            excellent location for whale viewing, which is best done in February and March.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"column2\">\n        <h3>UNAWATUNA BEACH</h3>\n        <img id=\"boximg\" src=\"Images/unwatuna.jpg\" alt=\"Unawatuna\">\n        <p>\n          The historical town of Galle, which is a fantastic city for visiting, is close to Unawatuna \n          and its beach. This was Sri Lanka's capital city when it was originally a colony of both Portugal \n          and Holland (at various points). Unawatuna, which is five kilometers outside of Galle, provides another \n          tiny piece of beach heaven.</p>\n  \n          <p>There is a sizable coral reef offshore in the region, which is also a popular ecotourism site. \n            Large and curved, the beach may get busy because it's one of the top beach resorts in the nation.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"column2\">\n        <h3>TANGALLE BEACH</h3>\n        <img id=\"boximg\" src=\"Images/tangalla.webp\" alt=\"Tangalle\">\n        <p>The hues of Tangalle, which lies on the southern coast, make for stunning Instagram pictures. \n          The brilliant blue ocean and pale sand stand up sharply against the lush, dark green vegetation \n          that flanks the beach. The beach edge is bordered by a substantial grove of trees, much like many \n          other beaches in Sri Lanka. Powdery, light gold-colored sand makes up the majority of the beach's \n          upper section, which slopes sharply toward the ocean.</p><br />\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <Footer></Footer>\n \n</template>\n<script>\nimport Footer from '@/components/FooterComp.vue'\n\nexport default {\nname: 'BeachView',\ncomponents: {\n  Footer,\n    }\n}\n</script>\n<style>\n.headerImg{\n  position: relative;\n  text-align: center;\n  color: black;\n  width: 100%;\n  font-size: 40px;\n  font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;;\n  }\n  .headerImgText {\n    position: absolute;\n    top: 50%;\n    left: 50%;\n    transform: translate(-50%, -50%);\n  }\n\n  .mainImg {\n    object-fit: cover;\n    object-position: 20% 50%;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 200px;  \n    opacity: 0.5;\n  }\n\n  .mainP {\n    padding-left: 5%;\n    padding-right: 5%;\n    font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n    font-weight: lighter;\n  }\n\n  @media sreen and (mad-width:500px){\n    .header{\n      padding: opx 20px;\n      background-color: purple;\n    }\n  }\n  \n\n  \np {\n      font-size:16px;\n      line-height:24px;\n      padding: 5px;\n    }\n      \n.container{\n      width:100%;\n      margin:0 auto;\n      display:flex;\n      list-style:none;\n    }\n           \n.row {\n  display: flex;\n  flex-wrap: wrap;\n  padding: 0 4px;\n}\n\n\n/* Sea Blue Boxes */\n\n.column1 {\n  flex: 29%;\n  max-width: 29%;\n  margin: 15px;\n  border: solid 7px #276F8B;\n  background-color: rgb(199, 231, 242);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\n\n/* Golden Boxes */\n\n.column2 {\n  flex: 29%;\n  max-width: 29%;\n  margin: 15px;\n  border: solid 7px #FAB453;\n  background-color: rgb(255, 255, 222);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\n\n/* Green Boxes */\n\n.column3 {\n  flex: 29%;\n  max-width: 29%;\n  margin: 15px;\n  border: solid 7px #357960;\n  background-color: rgb(241, 250, 241);\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\n\n#boximg{\n  vertical-align: middle;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 200px;\n  border-radius: 5px;\n}\n\n.card{\n      padding:15px 25px;\n    }\n      \n.columnimg{\n      max-width:100%;  \n    }\n  \n@media screen and (max-width: 768px){\n\n        .container{\n          width:100%;\n          margin:0 auto;\n          display:flex;\n          list-style:none;\n        }\n               \n    .row {\n      display: flex;\n      flex-wrap: wrap;\n      padding: 0 4px;\n    }\n    .column1 {\n      flex: 100%;\n      max-width: 100%;\n      margin: 15px;\n      border: solid 7px #276F8B;\n      background-color: rgb(199, 231, 242);\n      border-radius: 5px;\n    }\n    \n    /* Golden Boxes */\n    \n    .column2 {\n      flex: 100%;\n      max-width: 100%;\n      margin: 15px;\n      border: solid 7px #FAB453;\n      background-color: rgb(255, 255, 222);\n      border-radius: 5px;\n    }\n    \n    /* Green Boxes */\n    \n    .column3 {\n      flex: 100%;\n      max-width: 100%;\n      margin: 15px;\n      border: solid 7px #357960;\n      background-color: rgb(241, 250, 241);\n      border-radius: 5px;\n    }\n    \n    #boximg{\n      vertical-align: middle;\n      width: 100%;\n      height: 200px;\n      border-radius: 5px;\n    }\n    \n    .card{\n          padding:15px 25px;\n        }\n          \n    .columnimg{\n          max-width:100%;  \n        }\n      }\n</style>","import { render } from \"./BeachView.vue?vue&type=template&id=67ed7618\"\nimport script from \"./BeachView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./BeachView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./BeachView.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=67ed7618&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"/workspace/cey/node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_createElementVNode","id","src","alt","_hoisted_1","_hoisted_3","_hoisted_5","_hoisted_6","_createVNode","_component_P","_hoisted_8","_hoisted_9","_hoisted_10","_component_Footer","name","components","Footer","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
