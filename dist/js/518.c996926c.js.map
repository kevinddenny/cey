The notorious beaches of \n            Sri Lanka have long drawn tourists. The rest of the island, though, has \n            a lot more picturesque landscapes.<br>\n\n            Emerald tea plantations and sporadic waterfalls are scattered \n            across the central highlands. Cool temperatures, foggy vistas, \n            and charming estate cottages are remnants of bygone periods.<br>\n\n            Beautiful sunrises, luxuriant paddy fields, and a slower, more rural \n            pace of life may all be found on the island's east. Any tired traveler \n            will find solace in the vibrant houses of worship, national parks, ports \n            and harbors, and crystal-clear waterways.<br>\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n        <h3>LIPTON'S SEAT</h3>\n            This beautiful trek leads you through the tea plantations to the viewpoint\n             rumored to be Sir Thomas Lipton's favorite place to come and quietly \n             reflect and watch his estates. It begins at the ancient Dambatenne Tea \n             Factory in the Hill Country. On a clear day, it is possible to see all \n             the way to the shore from this vantage point, which rivals the \n             view from World's End.<br>\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n            Although it is not very difficult and older kids should have no trouble \n            doing it, keep in mind that climbing any distance in the heat might be \n            exhausting and that carrying water and supplies would be necessary.<br>\n        </p>\n            \n        <p>\n            <h3>TRAIN THROUGH THE HILL COUNTRY</h3>\n            The renowned rail system in Sri Lanka was built during the British colonial \n            era and is still a fascinating, archaic system today. There may not be \n            a finer or more pleasant way to see this amazing region of the country \n            than on this spectacular mountain road that winds majestically through \n            some of the island's least welcoming mountain routes. <br>\n        </p>\n\n        <p>One of Sri Lanka's most memorable adventures is the train ride from \n            Kandy up into the highest regions of the highlands, which passes through \n            heavily forested tea estates, isolated villages, and breathtaking waterfalls.<br>\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n        <h3>HORTON PLAINS & WORLDS END</h3>\n\n            In the shadow of Sri Lanka's second and third tallest mountains, The Horton \n            Plains is a stunning, peaceful, and mysterious place with some amazing walks. <br>\n\n            The plains itself comprise an undulating plateau with a high percentage of species that \n            are indigenous to the area. The area, which is at an elevation of 2,100-2,300 \n            meters and was designated a national park in 1988, is characterized by untamed \n            grasslands, scattered patches of dense forest, rocky outcrops, filigree waterfalls, \n            and hazy lakes.<br>\n        </p>\n        <p>\n            The plateau comes to an abrupt stop at Worlds End, where a stunning escarpment \n            sees the ground plunge 880 metres. If lucky enough, you will beat the fog and mist \n            to be able to see jaw dropping views of miniature tea plantation villages in the valley \n            below, all the way out to the south coast.<br>\n\n            Wake early for a walk through Horton Plains National Park up to Worlds End to avoid \n            the view being shrouded in mist and dont forget to pause a while at the 20 metre high \n            Bakers Falls, a waterfall formed by the tributary Belihul Oya and named after Sir Samuel \n            Baker, a hunter, explorer and early settler at Nuwara Eliya.<br>\n        </p>\n\n        <p>\n        <h3>SINHARAJA RAINFOREST</h3>\n            Sinharaja, in the southwest of Sri Lanka, is the last remaining piece of \n            primary tropical rainforest in the nation. The trees make up more than \n            60% of the population, and many of them are unusual. There is a lot of \n            endemic wildlife in the reserve, notably birds, but there are also many \n            different kinds of insects, reptiles, and uncommon amphibians, as well \n            as more than half of Sri Lanka's endemic butterfly and mammal species.\n        </p>\n    </div>\n   <Footer></Footer>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport Footer from '@/components/FooterComp.vue'\n\nexport default {\nname: 'ScenicView',\ncomponents: {\n  Footer,\n    }\n}\n</script>\n","import { render } from \"./ScenicView.vue?vue&type=template&id=00b3a2af\"\nimport script from \"./ScenicView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./ScenicView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"/workspace/cey/node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_2","_createVNode","_component_Footer","name","components","Footer","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
