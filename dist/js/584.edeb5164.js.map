Sri Lanka has it everything, whether you like\n        to do windsurfing, kayaking, yachting, water skiing, scuba diving, or\n        just relax for the ideal tan.<br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Beach vacations in Sri Lanka are an option all year round because to the\n        two monsoon winds that bring rain to the two corners of the island at\n        different times. From November to March, the north east breezes make the\n        south western coast bright and the sea tranquil. The East Coast seas are\n        calm due to the south-west breezes and the steady sunshine.<br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The nicest beaches in the South may be found at Tangalla, Beruwala,\n        Mirissa, Bentota, and Unawatuna. These beaches provide a variety of\n        amenities, including trendy boutique hotels, radiant coral reefs, calm\n        sandbars, and unexplored paradise spots.<br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Though foreign tourists have long been aware of Sri Lanka's southern\n        beaches, they are less familiar with its eastern shore. The Arugam Bay,\n        the high church of local surfers, is the most well-known of the Eastern\n        beaches. After a three decade civil war, Uppuveli beach is again\n        accessible to sun worshippers as well.<br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The Negambo lagoon is located north of Colombo in the country's western\n        tip. Its beaches, which are a longtime favorite of residents and\n        tourists from other countries, and its famous lagoon for lobster fishing\n        Despite having a ring of sandy beaches around it, the Colombians prefer\n        to spend their time in Galle Face Green, a half-kilometer tract between\n        Galle Road and the Indian Ocean.<br />\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <Footer></Footer>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport Footer from '@/components/FooterComp.vue'\n\nexport default {\nname: 'BeachView',\ncomponents: {\n  Footer,\n    }\n}\n</script>","import { render } from \"./BeachView.vue?vue&type=template&id=9d36d424\"\nimport script from \"./BeachView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./BeachView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"/workspace/cey/node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_2","_createVNode","_component_Footer","name","components","Footer","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
