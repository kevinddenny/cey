The city provides visitors with a spiritual encounter.<br></p><p><h3>TEMPLE OF TOOTH </h3> Known as Dalda Maligawa, it is situated in Kandy. The precious tooth of Lord Buddha is kept there, making it one of the most revered Buddhist pilgrimage destinations. According to legend, the tooth was snatched from the cremation pyre of Buddha in 543 BC and smuggled into Sri Lanka in the 4th century AD while being concealed in a princess&#39;s hair. The construction of the temple lasted about a century. 1687 saw the beginning of construction, which was completed in 1782. It is a large, pink-painted building that is encircled by a substantial moat. Three times a day—at 4.30 a.m., 10.30 a.m., and 6.30 p.m.—rituals are done. Shorts are not permitted within this shrine, and shoes must be taken off before entering.<br></p><p><h3>KATARAGAMA</h3> A well-liked center of worship for the native Vedda people of Sri Lanka and South India as well as for Buddhists, Muslims, Hindus, and Buddhists. The primary deity is the god Muruga.<br></p><p><h3>ADAM&#39;S PEAK </h3> A pyramidal peak standing 2,243 meters (7,359 feet) tall in the center of Sri Lanka. It is well-known for the Sri Pada &quot;holy footprint,&quot; a 1.8-meter rock creation near the peak that is thought to represent Adam in Muslim, Shiva in Hindu, and Buddha in Buddhist tradition.<br></p><p><h3>THE TEMPLE AND BOGODA BRIDGE</h3> An old temple and wooden bridge are located near the Hali-ela junction, around 30 kilometers from Bandarawela and 10 kilometers from Badulla. The Bogoda Bridge, which was built in the 1600s, is said to be the oldest wooden bridge still in existence. However, the nearby temple has a far older past, dating back to the first century BC. On an old path between Badulla and Kandy, a bridge was constructed over the Gallanda Oya. Eleven pairs of beautifully carved pillars and a railing of banisters hold the bridge in style.<br></p><p><h3>THE PADA YATRA</h3> Pilgrimage that takes place on foot from Jaffna to Kataragama along the East Coast, is one of Lanka&#39;s oldest customs. The Yatra&#39;s beginnings are hidden in legend. According to some tales, it all started when God Kataragama himself arrived on our beaches and made his way to Kataragama.<br> This 45-day, multireligious pilgrimage to Kataragama from Mullaittivu has established a tradition in Sri Lanka throughout the years. Villages along the road take part by giving the pilgrims, whom they see as the god&#39;s messengers, beverages, food, hospitality, and lodging. For millennia, Kataragama has also received &quot;calls&quot; from pilgrims in other countries as well as India.<br></p><p><h3>DAMBEGODA</h3> Avalokitheswara Bodhisattva, a statue of the Buddha that is 10 meters high, situated around 1 kilometer from Maligawila. This is said to be a celestial creature who choose to live on the human level in order to assist common people in finding redemption. One of the sixteen most revered Buddhist sites in Sri Lanka is Muthiyangana. The jawbone of Lord Buddha is kept at a temple there that dates back to the fourth century AD. During one of the Lord Buddha&#39;s three trips to Sri Lanka, it is said that he personally blessed this location.<br></p><p><h3>MALIGAWILA</h3> Located about 15 km to the south of Monaragala.

One of the statues is 11m high and is considered to be the world&#39;s largest free standing Buddha figure<br></p><p><h3>CAVE TEMPLE IN DOWA</h3> Situated on the Badulla-Bandarawella highway, 6 kilometers from Bandarawela. King Walagamba&#39;s sanctuary was the ancient cave temple complex, which was tucked away among the hills. The temple features a 38-foot-tall rock-sculpted Buddha figure in addition to a lovely decorative entryway. Additionally, there are also Kandyan-era paintings that reflect different Jataka tales.<br></p><p><h3>BUDURUWAGALA</h3> South of Wellawaya by 5 km. Literally, it refers to Buddha images. The Mahayana school of philosophy is represented by the complex of seven sculptures. The sculptures were created in the 10th century. There are still remnants of the enormous Buddha statue&#39;s original stuccoed garment, and a lengthy streak of orange paint reveals that it was previously vibrantly decorated. The Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, a representative of Buddhism, is regarded to be the primary figure of the trio to the Buddha&#39;s right. The female figure in the thrice-bent position to the left of this white-painted figure is considered to be Tara, his wife.<br></p></div><div><p><strong> Things to bring on a pilgrimage or meditation.</strong><ul><li> Little container that may be locked and contains your personal belongings. </li><li> Male pilgrims wear vetti, while female pilgrims wear sari. </li><li> Shawl to keep warm in the evening. </li><li> Bottle of water. </li><li> For people who are sensitive to sunlight, a small umbrella. </li><li> Pen and notepad for keeping track of your recollections. </li><li> The majority of sites charge visitors to snap photos there. </li></ul></p></div>',4);function n(e,a,t,n,s,h){const l=(0,i.up)("Footer");return(0,i.wg)(),(0,i.iD)("div",o,[r,(0,i.Wm)(l)])}var s=t(8949),h={name:"PilgrimView",components:{Footer:s.Z}},l=t(89);const d=(0,l.Z)(h,[["render",n]]);var u=d}}]);
