One of the oldest continuously inhabited\n        towns in the world and Sri Lanka's third and longest-serving capital is\n        also one of the most revered by Buddhists worldwide. It served as Sri\n        Lanka's capital from the Fourth Century BC to the start of the eleventh\n        Century and was one of South Asia's most enduring and stable hubs of\n        political authority and urban activity. <br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Some of the most cutting-edge landscaping features and some of the\n        oldest paintings ever discovered in the nation may be seen at Sigiriya,\n        a fortification and water park built in the fifth century AD.<br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        The Monarchy of Kandy, the final kingdom in Sri Lanka, is proof of the\n        country's people's capacity to emerge from the ashes. The Kandyan\n        Kingdom still has finely carved and constructed homes, palaces, and\n        temples that have been preserved for about 500 years despite having been\n        destroyed and decimated by the invading Portuguese more than three\n        times. <br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      <h3>YAPAHUWA CITADEL </h3>\n        The Yapahuwa citadel, one of Sri Lanka's flimsy medieval capital towns,\n        is constructed on a huge granite rock that abruptly rises from the\n        surrounding lowland plain. <br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Yapahuwa, which was the capital city in the second half of the 13th\n        century, was located in Wayamba Province midway between Kurunegala and\n        Anuradhapura. It functioned as a palace for King Buvanekabahu and a\n        military bastion against invasions from the north. A long, steep ornate\n        stairway leads to the Tooth Temple, where the Tooth Relic was carried\n        from Dambadeniya in 1272 before being kidnapped to South India by the\n        Pandyas in 1284. Traces of old structures and combat defenses may be\n        observed around the site.<br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      <h3>TANTIRIMALEE MONASTERY</h3>\n        The ancient monastic community of Tantirimalee dates back to the time\n        before Christ and is surrounded by an amazing sea of granite rock.<br />\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        A lily-strewn tank (ancient reservoir) will soon be reached as you make\n        your way across the rock surface, and if you keep going, descending down\n        into the dry lowland dipterocarp forest, you will ultimately find a\n        complex of caves with rock drawings dating back to the third century BC.\n        The drawings, which are allegedly meant to show pre-historic life with\n        humans and animals all depicted, require a \"creative\" mind to understand\n        the significance behind them, as even the instructions indicate.\n        However, to the untrained or \"uncreative\" eye, they mostly look like\n        noughts and crosses.<br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      <h3>SIGIRIYA ROCK FORTRESS</h3>\n        The huge rock column that rises approximately 200 meters high at the old\n        rock castle known as Sigiriya Lion Rock is its most distinctive feature.\n        The location was chosen as the new capital by King Kasyapa during his\n        reign (477-495 AD). He painted murals on the walls and constructed a\n        magnificent castle directly atop the granite column. The palace was only\n        accessible by a huge carved lion's mouth. It is situated at the top of a\n        granite mountain called \"Lion's Rock,\" which towers above the forest\n        from all sides and is 180 meters high. Access to the location is made\n        possible via a system of galleries and staircases that emerge from the\n        mouth of a massive lion made of brick and plaster. <br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      <h3>SINHARAJA RAINFOREST</h3>\n        Sinharaja, in the southwest of Sri Lanka, is the last remaining piece of\n        primary tropical rainforest in the nation. The trees make up more than\n        60% of the population, and many of them are unusual. There is a lot of\n        endemic wildlife in the reserve, notably birds, but there are also many\n        different kinds of insects, reptiles, and uncommon amphibians, as well\n        as more than half of Sri Lanka's endemic butterfly and mammal species.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n <Footer></Footer>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport Footer from '@/components/FooterComp.vue'\n\nexport default {\nname: 'HeritageView',\ncomponents: {\n  Footer,\n    }\n}\n</script>","import { render } from \"./HeritageView.vue?vue&type=template&id=27830ecc\"\nimport script from \"./HeritageView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./HeritageView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"/workspace/cey/node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_2","_createVNode","_component_Footer","name","components","Footer","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
