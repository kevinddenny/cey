These trips are \n        usually fun, although some of the tougher excursions might only be appealing \n        to more intrepid travellers.There are several locations with significant \n        historical and religious value in Sri Lanka, which is noted for its rich Buddhist culture and\n        history.<br />\n      </p>\n\n\n\n  <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"column2\">\n      <h3>ADAM'S PEAK </h3>\n      <img id=\"boximg\" src=\"Images/adamspeak.jpg\" alt=\"Adams peak\">\n        <p>The mountain goes by several names because of its importance to \n        the numerous people that live in the nation. <br>\n        The Sinhalese people frequently employ the Sanskrit-derived moniker \n        Sri Pada in religious contexts; which Buddhists consider to be the Buddha's. According to \n        Christian and Islamic beliefs, Adam's footprint, which he left while stepping onto \n        Earth for the first time after being expelled from paradise, is what gave it its \n        name \"Adam's Peak \".</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column2\">\n      <h3>THE TEMPLE AND BOGODA BRIDGE</h3>\n      <img id=\"boximg\" src=\"Images/Bogoda.jpg\" alt=\"Bogoda bridge\">\n      <p>\n        An old temple and wooden bridge are located near the Hali-ela junction,\n        around 30 kilometers from Bandarawela and 10 kilometers from Badulla.\n        The Bogoda Bridge, which was built in the 1600s, is said to be the\n        oldest wooden bridge still in existence. However, the nearby temple has\n        a far older past, dating back to the first century BC. On an old path\n        between Badulla and Kandy, a bridge was constructed over the Gallanda\n        Oya. Eleven pairs of beautifully carved pillars and a railing of\n        banisters hold the bridge in style.<br /></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"column2\">\n      <h3>THE PADA YATRA</h3>\n      <img id=\"boximg\" src=\"Images/padayatra.jpg\" alt=\"Pada yatra\">\n        <p>Pilgrimage that takes place on foot from Jaffna to Kataragama along the\n        East Coast, is one of Lanka's oldest customs. The Yatra's beginnings are\n        hidden in legend. According to some tales, it all started when God\n        Kataragama himself arrived on our beaches and made his way to\n        Kataragama.<br />\n\n        This 45-day, multireligious pilgrimage to Kataragama from Mullaittivu\n        has established a tradition in Sri Lanka throughout the years. Villages\n        along the road take part by giving the pilgrims, whom they see as the\n        god's messengers, beverages, food, hospitality, and lodging. For\n        millennia, Kataragama has also received \"calls\" from pilgrims in other\n        countries as well as India.<br />\n        </p>\n    </div>\n  </div>\n\n  <div class=\"row\">\n    <div class=\"column2\">\n      <h3>MALIGAWILA</h3>\n      <img id=\"boximg\" src=\"Images/maligawila.jpg\" alt=\"Maligawila\">\n       <p>It is the location of numerous significant archaeological artifacts, \n        including a free-standing, limestone Buddha statue that is 11 or 12 meters \n        tall (36 or 39 feet 4.4 inches), according to some sources. The Avukana Buddha \n        Statue is also supposed to be taller. Numerous visitors come to the area to see \n        this Buddha. Additionally, it is home to the 10 meters (32 feet 9.7 in) tall Avalokitesvara \n        statue made of limestone. These sculptures, which were found in the 1950s and repaired \n        between 1989 and 1991, are thought to have been ordered by the prince Agghabodhi of the \n        seventh century.
