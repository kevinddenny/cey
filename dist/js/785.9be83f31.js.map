Only a small portion of southern Sri\n        Lanka's river banks and the area surrounding Ratnapura include lush\n        tropical woods.<br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      <h3>HAKKGALA BOTANICAL GARDENS</h3>\n        The second-largest botanical garden in Sri Lanka is the Hakgala\n        Botanical Garden. It was founded in 1861 and is a component of the\n        Hakgala Strict Nature Reserve. The entire garden is separated into many\n        areas that are specifically devoted to different plant species, such as\n        ferns, cactus, orchids, etc. It also features a vast range of unusual\n        animal species. The distance from the city of Nuwara Eliya is around 5\n        kilometers, and it is located on the Badulla Highway. <br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      <h3>ROYAL BOTANICAL GARDENS</h3>\n        The Royal Botanical Gardens are the most well-known gardens in Sri Lanka\n        and are located 5 km west of Kandy. Tall trees, peaceful breezes,\n        colorful orchids, and close proximity to the Mahaweli River provide for\n        a stunning \"flora and aqua\" visual delight. The gardens are home to more\n        than 4000 species of plants, including orchids, spices, medicinal plants\n        and palm trees. It is a photographer's paradise with its 147 acres of\n        natural elegance, landscaped gardens, and scenic beauty.<br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      <h3>SEETHAWAKA WET ZONE BOTANICAL GARDENS</h3>\n        This location doubles as a research and conservation center because to\n        its extensive collection of rare flora. The 106-acre garden is located\n        near the Indikada Mukalana Forest Reserve on the Puwakpitiya-Thummodara\n        Road in Illukowita. The Seethawaka Wet Zone Botanic Gardens also include\n        a creek that runs through the garden, supplying irrigation water for the\n        wet zone plants. <br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      <h3>MIRIGAWILA BOTANICAL GARDENS</h3>\n        A dry zone may be found on the Colombo-Kataragama Road's 300-acre\n        Mirijjawila Botanical Garden. The retention of moisture in this area is\n        now feasible because to the building of three reservoirs: Kohombagas\n        Wewa, Demataththa Wewa, and Malitthangas Wewa. Battery-powered vehicles\n        make it easier for visitors to explore this massive site. <br />\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      <h3>SINHARAJA RAINFOREST</h3>\n        Sinharaja, in the southwest of Sri Lanka, is the last remaining piece of\n        primary tropical rainforest in the nation. The trees make up more than\n        60% of the population, and many of them are unusual. There is a lot of\n        endemic wildlife in the reserve, notably birds, but there are also many\n        different kinds of insects, reptiles, and uncommon amphibians, as well\n        as more than half of Sri Lanka's endemic butterfly and mammal species.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n<Footer></Footer>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport Footer from '@/components/FooterComp.vue'\n\nexport default {\nname: 'BotanicalView',\ncomponents: {\n  Footer,\n    }\n}\n</script>\n","import { render } from \"./BotanicalView.vue?vue&type=template&id=0fc4657a\"\nimport script from \"./BotanicalView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./BotanicalView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"/workspace/cey/node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_2","_createVNode","_component_Footer","name","components","Footer","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
