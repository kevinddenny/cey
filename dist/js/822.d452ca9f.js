All in all, we hope that this solution will help to boom the tourism industry of our country bringing in more and more tourists, thus, making Sri Lanka the world’s number one tourist destination. </p></div></div>',2);function s(e,t,o,s,r,l){const h=(0,i.up)("Footer");return(0,i.wg)(),(0,i.iD)("div",a,[n,(0,i.Wm)(h)])}var r=o(5412),l={name:"AboutView",components:{Footer:r.Z}},h=o(89);const u=(0,h.Z)(l,[["render",s]]);var c=u}}]);
