Magma has 10 manufacturing facilities across Sri Lanka\n          with over 700 employees working in each of our local facilities. Here,\n          Magma was awarded in to lead this project, in hopes to boost tourism\n          in the country. Here we wish to implement a web platform to provide a\n          unique experience for tourists. The portal is expected to be a\n          one-stop for tourist accommodation needs in the country.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>What is Cey.lk?</h2>\n\n        <p>\n          Sri Lanka has always been a hotspot for tourism due to its sun kissed\n          beaches, misty mountains and its thriving wild life. This making\n          tourism one of the largest industries of the country which helps to\n          increase the revenue of the economy.\n          <br />\n          However, with the digital revolution, Sri Lankan tourism is still in\n          the process of evolving into fully functioning, efficient and\n          accessible digital media. Thus, the country having no platform\n          currently launched which provides a one-stop accommodative application\n          for hotels and tourists to interact. <br />\n          Therefore, making the tourists having to go through various different\n          manual and digital platforms to receive information regarding their\n          travel experiences and hotels having to use various platforms to\n          market their brand and hotel promotions. Now, with the initiation of\n          our client, Cambio software, we intend to provide a working solution\n          to house all travelling and accommodative aspects in Sri Lanka in one\n          platform. <br />\n          Here, we intend to focus on providing travel and marketing solutions\n          to hotels, ranging from small guesthouses all the way to five star\n          hotels; and also, accommodative and travelling solutions for tourists,\n          both local and foreign. This allowing the Sri Lankan tourism industry\n          to finally reap the benefits of the digital revolution and use it to\n          bring in more revenue to the economy and provide a competitive\n          advantage over other tourist attractions across the globe.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>What do we hope to achieve?</h2>\n\n        <p>\n          With this platform we hope to provide a one-stop gateway for all\n          tourism needs and provide the country’s first digital platform for\n          tourists and hotels to interact easily, thereby making the Sri Lankan\n          tourism planning experience more streamlined, less time consuming,\n          less complicated and a more trustworthy experience for all parties\n          involved. All in all, we hope that this solution will help to boom the\n          tourism industry of our country bringing in more and more tourists,\n          thus, making Sri Lanka the world’s number one tourist destination.\n        </p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <Footer></Footer>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport Footer from '@/components/FooterComp.vue'\n\nexport default {\nname: 'AboutView',\ncomponents: {\n  Footer,\n    }\n}\n</script>\n\n<style>\n.aboutUsContainer {\n    display: grid;\n    grid-template-columns: 50% 50%;\n\n  }\n  \n  .aboutUsItem {\n    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);\n    padding: 20px;\n    font-size: 30px;\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n\n#sideImg {\n    height: 600px;\n    width: 100%;\n    border-radius: 15px;\n    padding: 10px;\n}\n\np {\n    font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n    font-size: medium;\n    text-decoration: solid;\n    text-align: justify;\n}\n\nh2 {\n  font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n  font-size: large;\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\n.mainImg {\n    width: 100%;\n    object-fit: cover;\n    object-position: 0% 70%;\n    width: 100%;\n    height: 200px;  \n    opacity: 0.5;\n}\n\n.headerImg {\n    position: relative;\n    text-align: center;\n    color: black;\n    font-size: 40px;\n    font-family: system-ui, -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Open Sans', 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif;;\n  }\n  \n  .headerText {\n      position: absolute;\n      top: 50%;\n      left: 50%;\n      transform: translate(-50%, -50%);\n  }\n\n  @media screen and (max-width: 768px){\n    #sideImg {\n      height: 300px;\n      width: 100%;\n      border-radius: 15px;\n      padding: 0;\n  }\n  \n  p {\n      font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n      font-size: medium;\n      text-decoration: solid;\n      text-align: justify;\n  }\n  \n  h2 {\n    font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;\n    font-size: large;\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n\n  .aboutUsContainer {\n    display: grid;\n    grid-template-columns: 100%;\n    width:100%;\n          margin:0 auto;\n          display:flex;\n\n  }\n  \n  .aboutUsItem {\n    background-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);\n    padding: 1px;\n    font-size: 30px;\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n  }\n</style>","import { render } from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=template&id=6f13fa92\"\nimport script from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport \"./AboutView.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&id=6f13fa92&lang=css\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"/workspace/cey/node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_2","_createVNode","_component_Footer","name","components","Footer","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
