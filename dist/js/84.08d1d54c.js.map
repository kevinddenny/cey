Sri Lanka still manages to\n        attract its guests, catching their imagination with sights, sounds, and\n        smells. Many who set foot on the island had believed it a part of a\n        divine existence. While Ayurveda and meditation continue to cure the\n        bodies and minds worn out by the pressures of life, Sri Lankan food is a\n        secret delight to many.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Ayurveda, the indigenous medical system of the nation, has evolved over\n        more than five thousand years. Up to the entrance of Western medicine in\n        the 19th century, it was the only therapeutic option available in the\n        region and was based on nutrition and herbs.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        A ideal mental state may be maintained in great part through meditation.\n        Three of the Noble Eightfold Path, right mindfulness, right\n        concentration, and right vision, are the core topics of Buddhist\n        meditation.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Shopping therapy is guaranteed to give you a temporary high, and Sri\n        Lanka offers excellent opportunities to indulge in it. You can choose\n        from dazzling jewels and jewelry, exquisitely carved wood, pottery and\n        metal ware, porcelain, batik, spices, and tea, despite the fact that it\n        won't heal your body or mind or elevate your senses to a godly realm.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n        Since their works were shipped to several parts of the civilized globe\n        over the past three thousand years, the craftsmanship of the nation's\n        jewelers, weavers, woodworkers, and ivory carvers has astounded the\n        world.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n\n    <div>\n      <!-- Here the google map feature is added with all the places-->\n    </div>\n    <Footer></Footer>\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nimport Footer from '@/components/FooterComp.vue'\n\nexport default {\nname: 'RelaxationView',\ncomponents: {\n  Footer,\n    }\n}\n</script>\n","import { render } from \"./RelaxationView.vue?vue&type=template&id=4b1e3369\"\nimport script from \"./RelaxationView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\nexport * from \"./RelaxationView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js\"\n\nimport exportComponent from \"/workspace/cey/node_modules/vue-loader/dist/exportHelper.js\"\nconst __exports__ = /*#__PURE__*/exportComponent(script, [['render',render]])\n\nexport default __exports__"],"names":["class","_createElementVNode","src","alt","_createElementBlock","_hoisted_2","_hoisted_3","_hoisted_4","_hoisted_5","_createVNode","_component_Footer","name","components","Footer","__exports__","render"],"sourceRoot":""}
