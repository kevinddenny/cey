        With approximately 1600 kilometres of perfectly cooked palm-fringed
        coastline around the nation, Sri Lanka is the ultimate vacation spot for
        beach lovers everywhere. Sri Lanka has it everything, whether you like
        to do windsurfing, kayaking, yachting, water skiing, scuba diving, or
        just relax for the ideal tan.<br />

        Beach vacations in Sri Lanka are an option all year round because to the
        two monsoon winds that bring rain to the two corners of the island at
        different times. From November to March, the north east breezes make the
        south western coast bright and the sea tranquil. The East Coast seas are
        calm due to the south-west breezes and the steady sunshine.<br />

        The nicest beaches in the South may be found at Tangalla, Beruwala,
        Mirissa, Bentota, and Unawatuna. These beaches provide a variety of
        amenities, including trendy boutique hotels, radiant coral reefs, calm
        sandbars, and unexplored paradise spots.<br />

        Though foreign tourists have long been aware of Sri Lanka's southern
        beaches, they are less familiar with its eastern shore. The Arugam Bay,
        the high church of local surfers, is the most well-known of the Eastern
        beaches. After a three decade civil war, Uppuveli beach is again
        accessible to sun worshippers as well.<br />

        The Negambo lagoon is located north of Colombo in the country's western
        tip. Its beaches, which are a longtime favorite of residents and
        tourists from other countries, and its famous lagoon for lobster fishing
        Despite having a ring of sandy beaches around it, the Colombians prefer
        to spend their time in Galle Face Green, a half-kilometer tract between
        Galle Road and the Indian Ocean.<br />
