        Within less than 200 km on this relatively small island, one can travel
        through ten or twelve distinct vegetation patterns, each of which offers
        an abundance of various fruits, including bananas in various varieties,
        coconuts, cashew nuts, mangoes of various shapes, sizes, and colors,
        guavas, pawpaws, litchis, delicate mangosteens, and breadfruit, which
        tastes better than it smells. <br />

        Huge tea plantations cover some areas of the island, while the forest,
        which is home to many large trees, provides materials like iron wood
        trees (Mesua ferrea), banyans with their ramified trunks, and the
        attractive breadfruit tree with its pumpkin-sized fruit, which when ripe
        smells like a well-aged cheese. Only a small portion of southern Sri
        Lanka's river banks and the area surrounding Ratnapura include lush
        tropical woods.<br />

      <h3>HAKKGALA BOTANICAL GARDENS</h3>
        The second-largest botanical garden in Sri Lanka is the Hakgala
        Botanical Garden. It was founded in 1861 and is a component of the
        Hakgala Strict Nature Reserve. The entire garden is separated into many
        areas that are specifically devoted to different plant species, such as
        ferns, cactus, orchids, etc. It also features a vast range of unusual
        animal species. The distance from the city of Nuwara Eliya is around 5
        kilometers, and it is located on the Badulla Highway. <br />

      <h3>ROYAL BOTANICAL GARDENS</h3>
        The Royal Botanical Gardens are the most well-known gardens in Sri Lanka
        and are located 5 km west of Kandy. Tall trees, peaceful breezes,
        colorful orchids, and close proximity to the Mahaweli River provide for
        a stunning "flora and aqua" visual delight. The gardens are home to more
        than 4000 species of plants, including orchids, spices, medicinal plants
        and palm trees. It is a photographer's paradise with its 147 acres of
        natural elegance, landscaped gardens, and scenic beauty.<br />

      <h3>SEETHAWAKA WET ZONE BOTANICAL GARDENS</h3>
        This location doubles as a research and conservation center because to
        its extensive collection of rare flora. The 106-acre garden is located
        near the Indikada Mukalana Forest Reserve on the Puwakpitiya-Thummodara
        Road in Illukowita. The Seethawaka Wet Zone Botanic Gardens also include
        a creek that runs through the garden, supplying irrigation water for the
        wet zone plants. <br />

      <h3>MIRIGAWILA BOTANICAL GARDENS</h3>
        A dry zone may be found on the Colombo-Kataragama Road's 300-acre
        Mirijjawila Botanical Garden. The retention of moisture in this area is
        now feasible because to the building of three reservoirs: Kohombagas
        Wewa, Demataththa Wewa, and Malitthangas Wewa. Battery-powered vehicles
        make it easier for visitors to explore this massive site. <br />

      <h3>SINHARAJA RAINFOREST</h3>
        Sinharaja, in the southwest of Sri Lanka, is the last remaining piece of
        primary tropical rainforest in the nation. The trees make up more than
        60% of the population, and many of them are unusual. There is a lot of
        endemic wildlife in the reserve, notably birds, but there are also many
        different kinds of insects, reptiles, and uncommon amphibians, as well
        as more than half of Sri Lanka's endemic butterfly and mammal species.
