        With a 3000 year history, Sri Lanka is home to some of the world's most
        ancient cities, such as Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, and Digamadulla.
        These cities' once magnificent townships, palaces, temples, monasteries,
        hospitals, and theaters, all of which were intricately carved and
        modeled out of stone, have since been abandoned and forgotten amidst the
        country's towering jungles.<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        The Kingdom of Anuradhapura is the most renowned and beautiful of all
        the ancient cities in Lanka. One of the oldest continuously inhabited
        towns in the world and Sri Lanka's third and longest-serving capital is
        also one of the most revered by Buddhists worldwide. It served as Sri
        Lanka's capital from the Fourth Century BC to the start of the eleventh
        Century and was one of South Asia's most enduring and stable hubs of
        political authority and urban activity. <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of the most cutting-edge landscaping features and some of the
        oldest paintings ever discovered in the nation may be seen at Sigiriya,
        a fortification and water park built in the fifth century AD.<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        The Monarchy of Kandy, the final kingdom in Sri Lanka, is proof of the
        country's people's capacity to emerge from the ashes. The Kandyan
        Kingdom still has finely carved and constructed homes, palaces, and
        temples that have been preserved for about 500 years despite having been
        destroyed and decimated by the invading Portuguese more than three
        times. <br />
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3>YAPAHUWA CITADEL </h3>
        The Yapahuwa citadel, one of Sri Lanka's flimsy medieval capital towns,
        is constructed on a huge granite rock that abruptly rises from the
        surrounding lowland plain. <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        Yapahuwa, which was the capital city in the second half of the 13th
        century, was located in Wayamba Province midway between Kurunegala and
        Anuradhapura. It functioned as a palace for King Buvanekabahu and a
        military bastion against invasions from the north. A long, steep ornate
        stairway leads to the Tooth Temple, where the Tooth Relic was carried
        from Dambadeniya in 1272 before being kidnapped to South India by the
        Pandyas in 1284. Traces of old structures and combat defenses may be
        observed around the site.<br />
      </p>

      <p>
      <h3>TANTIRIMALEE MONASTERY</h3>
        The ancient monastic community of Tantirimalee dates back to the time
        before Christ and is surrounded by an amazing sea of granite rock.<br />
      </p>
      <p>
        A lily-strewn tank (ancient reservoir) will soon be reached as you make
        your way across the rock surface, and if you keep going, descending down
        into the dry lowland dipterocarp forest, you will ultimately find a
        complex of caves with rock drawings dating back to the third century BC.
        The drawings, which are allegedly meant to show pre-historic life with
        humans and animals all depicted, require a "creative" mind to understand
        the significance behind them, as even the instructions indicate.
        However, to the untrained or "uncreative" eye, they mostly look like
        noughts and crosses.<br />
      </p>

      <h3>SIGIRIYA ROCK FORTRESS</h3>
        The huge rock column that rises approximately 200 meters high at the old
        rock castle known as Sigiriya Lion Rock is its most distinctive feature.
        The location was chosen as the new capital by King Kasyapa during his
        reign (477-495 AD). He painted murals on the walls and constructed a
        magnificent castle directly atop the granite column. The palace was only
        accessible by a huge carved lion's mouth. It is situated at the top of a
        granite mountain called "Lion's Rock," which towers above the forest
        from all sides and is 180 meters high. Access to the location is made
        possible via a system of galleries and staircases that emerge from the
        mouth of a massive lion made of brick and plaster. <br />

      <h3>SINHARAJA RAINFOREST</h3>
        Sinharaja, in the southwest of Sri Lanka, is the last remaining piece of
        primary tropical rainforest in the nation. The trees make up more than
        60% of the population, and many of them are unusual. There is a lot of
        endemic wildlife in the reserve, notably birds, but there are also many
        different kinds of insects, reptiles, and uncommon amphibians, as well
        as more than half of Sri Lanka's endemic butterfly and mammal species.
